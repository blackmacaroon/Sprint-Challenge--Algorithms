#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
Constant  O(1)
the runtime is unaffected by the size of the input

b)
Logarithmic O(log n)
as the size of the input increases, the runtime grows but at a slightly slower rate


c)
Linear O(n)
the runtime shrinks/grows at the same rate and the input

## Exercise II

#
I'd climb to n//2 and drop an egg
if it doesn't break I head UP
if it breaks, I head DOWN 

i'd divide the remaining floors head to the middle one. Drop another egg.

if it doesn't break I head UP
if it breaks, I head DOWN

i'd divide the remaining floors head to the middle one. Drop another egg.

if it doesn't break I head UP
if it breaks, I head DOWN

i'd divide the remaining floors head to the middle one. Drop another egg.

if it doesn't break I head UP
if it breaks, I head DOWN

i'd divide the remaining floors head to the middle one. Drop another egg.

if it doesn't break I head UP
if it breaks, I head DOWN

i'd divide the remaining floors head to the middle one. Drop another egg.

if it doesn't break I head UP
if it breaks, I head DOWN

until i'm out of floors or I find the one where it stops breaking. I suspect it would be the bottom floor.
binary sort is O(log(n))
